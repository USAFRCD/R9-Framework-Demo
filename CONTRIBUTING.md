# Contributing to the ℝ∅ Symbolic Collapse Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ℝ∅ (R-null) symbolic framework. This project explores symbolic methods for resolving irrationality, entropy, and observer-relative identity collapse.

## How to Contribute

### 📬 Submitting Use Cases or Theoretical Extensions
- Use consistent symbolic notation (⦵, ⊗, 0̷)
- Proposals should align with ℝ∅ axioms or build meaningfully upon collapse logic
- Submit as a Markdown file or issue with clear formatting and justification

### 🧠 Submitting Symbolic Proofs or Derivations
- Label proofs using “Theorem X.Y” or “Collapse Identity Z”
- Clearly show digit root behavior and convergence logic
- Include collapse operators and observer perspective where relevant

### 🧪 Contributing Code
- All code should simulate or visualize collapse mechanics
- Use Python where possible, with clear inline comments
- Place new files inside the `/simulations` folder and document in README

## Standards
- Always cite ℝ∅ origin as:  
  *ℝ∅: Symbolic Collapse Framework for Irrational Singularities (2025)*  
- Maintain clarity: symbolic precision > algebraic complexity
- No commercial forks or redistribution per LICENSE (CC BY-NC 4.0)
