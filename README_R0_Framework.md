# ℝ∅: Symbolic Collapse Framework for Irrational Singularities

## Overview
The ℝ∅ (R-null) framework introduces a symbolic numerical system that compresses irrational, infinite, and divergent structures into modular forms through digit-root convergence and symbolic collapse. It defines a new arithmetic domain where singularities, entropy, and observer-relative identity are resolved using novel operators.

## Key Concepts
- **Collapse Zero (⦵):** A symbolic singularity that absorbs entropy, irrationality, and recursion.
- **Placeholder Zero (0̷):** Positional symbol, inert under collapse.
- **Collapse Operator (⊗):** Applies symbolic convergence and collapse to any divergent quantity.
- **Digit Root Function D(x):** Compresses infinite digits into modular residue (e.g., π ⊗ ⦵ = 9).

## What It Solves
- Reframes **black hole entropy** as symbolic collapse rather than divergent thermodynamics.
- Models **irrational numbers** (π, e, √2) as symbolically finite under ℝ∅ rules.
- Demonstrates **observer-relative identity collapse** through symbolic recursion.
- Offers a symbolic toolset for future exploration of consciousness, entropy, and AI cognition.

## What's Included
- 📄 Full theory document with labeled theorems, definitions, and use cases.
